# Text-Based Banking System

## Overview
This project is a **text-based banking system** that uses an interactive, menu-driven approach to manage accounts, transactions, and administrative operations.

Key features include:
- **Account Management**: Accounts are stored as instances of a user-defined class, keyed by account numbers in a dictionary.
- **Account Number Assignment**: Each new account is automatically assigned a unique, randomly generated 8-digit account number.
- **Account Types**: Supports two types of accounts â€” Savings (S) and Current (C).
- **Single System**: Accessible by both users and bank admins, with admin access protected by a hard-coded password (modifiable by admins, initially set to 1234).

### User Features
Users can:
- Create an account.
- Check their account balance.
- Deposit or withdraw funds.
- Transfer funds to another account.

### Admin Features
Admins can:
- Change the admin password.
- Create multiple accounts at once using a CSV or text file with comma-separated values.
- Export account registries to a CSV file.
- Delete user accounts.
